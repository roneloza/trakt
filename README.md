Track.Tv

THE CHALLENGE
Task: Implement a small app which interacts with the trakt.tv API (http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/).
_When the app is started, a list of the currently 10 most popular movies is displayed.
_As soon as the user scrolls down and reaches the end of the list, the next 10 movies are
loaded (and so on).
_Another functionality is the search: the user should have the possibility to search the trakt.tv
API for a keyword. It is important that the search is automatically triggered, i.e. the search is
automatically executed while typing the search term. When the user continues typing, the old
search should be cancelled and a search for the new term must be started.
_The search results should be scrollable via pagination as well.
_Important properties to show in the search results are the movie title (title), the year of release
(year), the overview (overview) without truncation and a picture.
HINT: The UI, programming language, 3rd party frameworks, supported iOS versions and
design are explicitly "developer's choice".
